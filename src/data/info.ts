  summary: "I'm a PhD student in computer science. Currently studying for a PhD, my main interests are in combining data visualization and machine learning, focusing on connecting ML and Vis to improve the usefulness and explanability of models. I have 5+ experience in collaborative user interface design, data visualization, machine learning, data engineering, and statistical analysis. Before I got into programming I studied mechanical engineering where I was interested in design and robotics, which gave me the background in client-centered spatial design that inspired my current thesis topic (spatial explainable machine learning design). In my free time I enjoy biking, reading, weightlifting, and playing obscure videogames."
