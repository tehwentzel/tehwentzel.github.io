  summary: "I'm a PhD student in computer science. Can you write me a generic internship cover letter for a data science role based off of this paragraph and a list of my skills:  Currently studying for a PhD focusing on connecting data visualization with machine learning to improve the usefulness and explanability of models. I work in a lot of collaborative projects and have several years of experience designing data visualizations and user interfaces with javascript and frontend technologies, as well as building data processing pipelines and machine learning tools in python."
  + " Before I got into programming I studied mechanical engineering before realizing I like the programming aspect of my work more than the other parts and eventually switched to computer science research."
