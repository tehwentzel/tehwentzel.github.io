  summary: "Currently studying for a PhD focusing on connecting data visualization with machine learning to improve the usefulness and explanability of models. I work in a lot of collaborative projects and have several years of experience desinging data visualizaitons and user interfaces with javascript and frontend technologies, as well as builing data processing pipelines and machine learning tools in python."
  + " Before I got into programming I studied mechanical engineering before realizing I like the programming aspect of my work more than the other parts and eventually switched to computer science research. Fortunately, it turns out it's pretty easy to just learn how to program on the fly."
